## What is the Vigenère cipher 
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher):

  The *Vigenère cipher* (French pronunciation: [viʒnɛːʁ]) is a method of encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, whose increment is determined by the corresponding letter of another text, the key.
